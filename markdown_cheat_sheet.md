# This is an h1 heading

This is a paragraph
of text. It can go on multiple
lines.

This is a second paragraph.

## This is an h2 heading

And this is a bulleted list:

- one
- two
- three
- and a fourth item
  that wraps a couple lines

Sometimes you want to make text **bold** or _italic_.

And sometimes you want to [link some text](http://google.com/)
to another page.

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

```ruby
Blocks of code are written between three back-ticks.
This is one such example.
I am writing multiple lines inside a block.
```

### Of course, this is an h3 heading
