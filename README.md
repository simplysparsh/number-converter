# Number Converter

This app converts arabic numbers to roman numbers.

## Development

This is a standard Ruby command-line application.
You can run the test suite by running `rspec`.

The aim behind creating this app is to practice Test driven Development and writing clean code.
This app was not built with an intent to find a good algorithm. Although, I'll work on it at a
later stage.
